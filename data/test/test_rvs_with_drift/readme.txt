Note that for all objects below, "vrad" is given in km/s, whereas "vr_drift" and "constant" are in m/s.
"vr_drift" is the drift measured from SOPHIE calibration lamps.
"constant" is the drift measured from the monitored standard stars.
If you consider vrad0 as the observed radial velocity without any drift correction, the corrected vrad values I provide you are:
vrad = vrad0 + vr_drift + constant.
